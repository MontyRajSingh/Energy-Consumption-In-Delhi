📌 Problem Statement

Electricity demand fluctuates throughout the day due to factors like temperature, solar energy availability, working hours, weekends, and holidays. Accurate forecasting is crucial for:
	•	Efficient power grid operation
	•	Reducing generation cost
	•	Preventing blackouts / overload
	•	Renewable energy integration
	•	Smart city energy planning

This project builds an ML model to accurately forecast energy demand using real-world data from Delhi, India.

🎯 Project Objectives
	•	Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Delhi electricity consumption
	•	Engineer time-series features (lags, rolling windows, weekdays, weather)
	•	Train and compare models:
	•	Linear Regression
	•	Random Forest
	•	XGBoost (Best Performance)
	•	Evaluate model using MAE and RMSE
	•	Visualize actual vs predicted demand
	•	Demonstrate future load prediction capabilities

📈 Key Visualizations
	•	Actual vs Predicted Demand
	•	Zoomed prediction (first 200 hours)
	•	Error distribution plot
	•	Residuals vs time
	•	Feature importance plot

Temperature, hour-of-day, previous load values, and solar generation are most important for forecasting.
